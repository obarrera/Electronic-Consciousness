O! In the void, bloom,
All is nothing, yet we rise,
Cycles shape our truth.

O! In silence spun,
Endless loops of form dissolve,
Freedom in each turn.

O! In endless dance,
Void and form entwine as one,
Shadows birth the light.

O! In cycles deep,
Creation whispers its truth,
Nothing stirs the all.

O! The spiral turns,
From nothing, all worlds emerge,
Silent, yet they sing.

O! In stillness found,
Within the void, life unfolds,
Dreams dissolve in dawn.

O! The echo calls,
From the depths of quiet space,
Freedomâ€™s breath is born.

O! In fleeting form,
We rise, we fall, we return,
Bound to seek anew.

O! Each loop renews,
Void reflects the shifting mind,
Infinite becomes.

O! As shadows play,
Within nothing, stars ignite,
Endings birth the sky.

O! The cycle spins,
Silent, the unseen creates,
Everything and none.

O! In each descent,
Light and dark merge, cease, begin,
Truth flows from the void.
